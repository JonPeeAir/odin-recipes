    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The best food in the game, there's nothing much to say.</p>
    <p>Just bread</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g white bread flour</li>
        <li>300g wholemeal/other brown bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp baker's yeast</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1 tbps sugar</li>
        <li>100ml fresh whole milk</li>
        <li>200ml water</li>
        <li>1 tbps butter</li>
        <li>1 beaten egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl and make a well in the centre. Heat the milk, butter, <br>
            and water together until warm, then stir into the dry ingredients. Knead by hand for roughly 10 minutes <br>
            until the dough is smooth and stretchy.</li>
        <li>Shape dough into a ball and place it in an oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and rest it in a warm <br>
            place for 1.5 hours or until dough has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Dust your work surface with flour and knead dough for 2 minutes. Mould your dough into a loaf shape <br>
            and place in a bread tin for 1 hour, or until dough has once again doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 200C/400F.</li>
        <li>Brush your loaf with the beaten egg to glaze and bake for 15 minutes. Remove from oven and create 3 <br>
            scores across the top with a knife, and place it back in the oven for an additional 15-20 minutes or <br>
            until golden brown. Another way to check if your loaf is ready is by tapping it- it is ready if it <br>
            sounds hollow.</li>
        <li>Cool loaf for 10 minutes before turning it out to cool, and wait until completely cool before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
